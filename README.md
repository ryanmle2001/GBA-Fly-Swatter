Welcome to Ryan Le's CS2110 Game Boy Game: Fly Swatter!

I'm very excited to present to you my first ever GBA / C game!
Written for CS 2110 under Professor Caleb Southern

Story:
- What was once an ordinary day on the farm turns into a home invasion of a plague of flies!
- Defend your precious fruit from the hands of these evil pests with your trusty fly swatter!

Objective:
- SURVIVE!
- Increase your score by eliminating flies by contacting your fly swatter with the flies!
- Every five flies you eliminate adds another life to your life count. You start with five lives, and every time a fly touches your apple, you lose one life!
- There are always six flies on the screen: swatting one away spawns another on the map at a random location!
